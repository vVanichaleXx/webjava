WebJava Framework

WebJava is a robust and versatile Java framework designed for the static generation of websites.
It provides an intuitive interface for creating raw `.htm` files, enabling users to build web pages
without requiring in-depth knowledge of traditional web technologies such as HTM, CSS, and JavaScript.

The primary objective of WebJava is to simplify the process of website creation, making it accessible
to a broader audience, including those who may not have a technical background. Through its user-friendly
design, WebJava empowers users to generate static web pages with minimal effort, streamlining the development
process and reducing the complexity associated with modern web development.

The WebJava framework is engineered to be lightweight yet powerful, ensuring that users can efficiently
produce high-quality websites that meet their specific needs. Whether for personal projects, small businesses,
or educational purposes, WebJava offers a reliable solution that caters to a wide range of web development
requirements.
